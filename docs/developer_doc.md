## Architecture

### Project Structure
BetterGR follows a modular structure, with each repository representing a specific domain or functionality. 

The key components include:
- **API Gateway**: Acts as the central entry point for client requests, handling routing, authentication, and communication between the frontend and backend microservices.
- **Microservices**: Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain, such as Students, Courses, Grades, Homework, and Staff.
- **Frontend**: Built using Nuxt.js and Vue.js, the frontend provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the platform.
- **Database**: Each microservice has its own dedicated database to ensure data isolation and scalability.

### Key Modules and Components
**1.** **API Gateway**:
   - Handles authentication and authorization using Keycloak
   - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices via gRPC
   - Translates gRPC responses into GraphQL responses for the frontend

**2.** **Microservices**:
   - **Students Microservice**: Manages student-related operations.
   - **Staff Microservice**: Handles staff-related functionalities.
   - **Courses Microservice**: Manages course-related workflows.
   - **Homework Microservice**: Handles assignments ,submissions and announcements.
   - **Grades Microservice**: Manages grading operations.

**3.** **Frontend**:
   - Developed using Nuxt.js, Vue.js and TypeScript
   - Communicates with the API Gateway via GraphQL queries and mutations

**4.** **Databases**:
   - SQL databases are used for storing domain-specific data
   - Each microservice has its own database schema optimized for its functionality

### Configuration
BetterGR uses environment variables to configure the application. These variables are defined in `.env` files and include:
- **Database connection strings**: For connecting to microservice-specific databases.
- **Keycloak settings**: For authentication and authorization.
- **gRPC settings**: For inter-service communication.
- **API Gateway settings**: For routing and GraphQL configuration.

### Environment Variables:
Environment variables are used to manage sensitive information and application settings. Examples include:
API_GATEWAY_PORT: Port for the API Gateway configuration.
CLIENT_SECRET: Secret key used for authentication purposes.
KEYCLOAK_URL: URL for the Keycloak authentication server.
REDIRECT_URI: URI for handling authentication callbacks.
GRADES_PORT, STUDENTS_PORT, HOMEWORK_PORT, COURSES_PORT, STAFF_PORT: Ports for microservice communication.

## Database Setup
Each microservice in BetterGR uses a dedicated PostgreSQL database to ensure data isolation and scalability. 

The setup process includes:

**1.** **Database Initialization**:
   - Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and schemas for each microservice.
   - Example command to execute a script:
     ```bash
     psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f <script_name>.sql
     ```
**2.** **Database Connection Configuration**:
    

- Configure the connection details in the `.env` file for each microservice. Example environment variables:

       ```
        # API Gateway Configuration
        API_GATEWAY_PORT=1234
        
        # Authentication Settings
        CLIENT_SECRET=**********
        KEYCLOAK_URL=http://auth.betterGR.org
        REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
        
        # Microservice Addresses
        GRADES_PORT=localhost:50051
        STUDENTS_PORT=localhost:50052
        HOMEWORK_PORT=localhost:50053
        COURSES_PORT=localhost:50054
        STAFF_PORT=localhost:50055
       ```


**3.** **Indexing and Optimization**:
  - Ensure proper indexing for frequently queried columns to improve performance.
  - Example SQL for creating an index:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_course_name ON courses(name);
    ```


## Third-Party Integrations
BetterGR integrates with several third-party tools to enhance functionality:
- **Keycloak**: Provides authentication and authorization services, including role-based access control.
- **gRPC**: Enables efficient and reliable communication between microservices.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing services to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

## Microservices

### Overview of Microservices Architecture
BetterGR employs a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific domain, allowing independent development, deployment and scaling. Communication between microservices is facilitated using gRPC, ensuring efficient and reliable inter-service communication. The architecture also integrates with the API-Gateway, which acts as the central entry point for client requests and handles routing, authentication, and GraphQL query processing.

Key features of the microservices architecture:
- **Domain-specific services**: Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain, such as Students, Courses, Grades, Homework, and Staff.
- **Independent databases**: Each microservice has its own PostgreSQL database to ensure data isolation and scalability.
- **Inter-service communication**: gRPC is used for efficient communication between microservices.
- **API Gateway**: Provides a unified interface for frontend communication and handles authentication via Keycloak.

# Grades Microservice Documentation


## Overview


The grades domain manages all students' grades in each course. Course staff can edit the students' grades, and each student can view their own grades.

- **Courses Microservice**: to retrieve course-related information.
- **Homework Microservice**: to manage homework-related data and grades.
- **Staff Microservice**: to verify course staff permissions for grade modifications.
- **Students Microservice**: to fetch student-related information and validate student identities.
